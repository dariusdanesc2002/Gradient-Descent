# Gradient-Descent
Here, you'll find an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm in C++. Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In this implementation, we apply the algorithm to optimize a given objective function, without access to its derivative. Feel free to modify the objective function according to your requirements.
# Reminder
Depending on the characteristics of your objective function and the initial starting point, you may need to adjust certain parameters such as the learning rate (lambda) or the convergence threshold (epsilon) to achieve optimal results.
